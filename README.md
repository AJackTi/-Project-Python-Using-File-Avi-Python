Using Cv2 to View File Avi.

Audio Video Interleave (also Audio Video Interleaved), known by its initials AVI, is a multimedia container format introduced by Microsoft in November 1992 as part of its Video for Windows software. AVI files can contain both audio and video data in a file container that allows synchronous audio-with-video playback. Like the DVD video format, AVI files support multiple streaming audio and video, although these features are seldom used. Most AVI files also use the file format extensions developed by the Matrox OpenDML group in February 1996. These files are supported by Microsoft, and are unofficially called "AVI 2.0".

You can click button [Open File] to open file. 
Note: You only open in the GUI, and with more two GUI it will error because web service allows only open file once.

You can open file .avi with button [Browse] to open files on your computer. With it, file-open will have a sound, whereas with opening file in web server is not sound.
